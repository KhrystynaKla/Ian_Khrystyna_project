# UA/USA Flashcards

We made a spaced repetition flashcard app for English/Ukrainian learning.

## How does it Work

There is a menu that allows the user to look at flashcards and assess the difficulty.

While doing a study session of 20 words, The user may drop the cards if they are confident the vocabulary is in their long term memory, or else rate its difficulty. This information is stored on a database and creates a due date for the word to be studied again. The next time a user plays, it takes the first 20 words in chronological order of their due dates, and if more are necessary goes through the list.

If a user drops a card by accident, we have an option that lets you go through your dropped cards and undo a drop.

There is also a quiz mode where the user must guess the correct answer.

We used AI (Bard, Claude, ChatGPT) to generate the text on the flashcards, including sample sentences in both languages.

We also used a random word generator to come up with most of the English words to plug into our AI.

The game is played in the pygame environment.
